            <summary>
            Compresses a supplied byte array.
            Returns the compressed version of the byte array.

            <param name="data">The byte array containing the file or data to compress.</param>
            <param name="searchBufferSize">(Default = 0x1FFF)
            A value preferably between 0xFF and 0x1FFF that declares how many bytes
            the compressor visit before any specific byte to search for matching patterns.
            Increasing this value compresses the data to smaller filesizes at the expense of compression time.
            Changing this value has no noticeable effect on decompression time.</param>

            Decodes the PRS compressed stream and returns the size of the PRS compressed
            file, if it were to be decompressed. This operation is approximately 18 times
            faster than decompressing and may be useful in some situations.
